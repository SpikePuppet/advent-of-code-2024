# Advent of Code 2024

This years advent of code! I'm giving it my best shot.

All done in TypeScript, and want to ensure we keep as minimal dependencies as possible. If I can do it myself, or copy and paste something I understand, let's do that!

The idea here is that each day will be split up into it's own folder, and each question in the day exists in it's own script. There isn't a folder structure here - it's entirely mean't to be part of a pragmatic approach to just solving the issue using ol' fashioned code.
